  /**
    CLOSURE ASSIGNMENT!

    LEVEL 1: In playground.js, fix the iterative loop so that when you receive calls back from the server, the correct
      value for i is returned.
    
    LEVEL 2: Wrap playground.js in the revealing module pattern. Put your working AJAX call into a private function,
      and then return an object from the module which has a property that references your new private function.

    LEVEL 3: Upon retrieving all of the callbacks to the server, sort them and construct the entire ordered string.
      Pass this string from the module, and then in this script tag, append them to #container.
